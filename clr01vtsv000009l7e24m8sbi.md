## Why we need this?

- In case we want to know which tag is newest.
- We want to know tag description by commit message.

## Git command options

```bash
git log --no-walk --tags --pretty="%h %d %s" --decorate=full | grep "tag-name"
```

Output's template:

```txt
<shortened version of commit hash>  (tag: <tag name>, tag: <another tag>, ...) <commit message>
# for example
# abc123456  (tag: refs/tags/xxx.v1) fix: bug when something has changed
```
