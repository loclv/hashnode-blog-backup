Long ago, people knew about meditation and its benefits for reducing stress, improving focus, and promoting overall well-being. But did you know that meditation can also be applied to programming?

For programmers, the act of coding can be deeply focused.

Here are some tips on how to apply meditation to programming:

### 1 - Single-tasking

When coding, at a time only do 1 thing, and when done, move on to another job. It sounds pretty easy, but we often get distracted thinking about the solution and converting it into code syntax.

Let's focus on the solution first. If the solution is complicated then list it as a comment in the code. After that, refactor the logic for better performance. Then convert it to code syntax. Again, refactor according to the pattern and so on.

### 2 - Quiet time

Give yourself a quiet time of 15 to 30 minutes to code and then communicate with your teammate.

### 3 - Take breaks

Take a break with coffee or a little water. Incorporate short meditation breaks throughout your programming day. These breaks will help you recharge and refocus your mind, which can lead to increased productivity and creativity.

### 4 - Breath

Focus on your breath when you feel tired.

### 5 - Observe your thoughts

As you meditate, it's common for your mind to wander. When this happens, simply observe the thought without judgment and then gently bring your focus back to the present.
